#This is a Python script that uses the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on the sentences of a given text file, and writes the results to a CSV file.

The script starts by importing the required libraries, which are TextBlob for performing sentiment analysis, and csv for writing data to a CSV file.

Next, two file paths are defined: the path to the input text file and the path to the output CSV file. The script will read the input file, perform sentiment analysis on each sentence in the file, and write the results to the CSV file.

A list of fieldnames for the CSV file is defined next. These fieldnames are 'SENTENCE_ID', 'POLARITY', 'SUBJECTIVEITY', 'SENTENCE', and 'STRONG OPINION'. These correspond to the sentence ID, sentiment polarity, subjectivity score, sentence text, and whether the sentence has a strong opinion, respectively.

The script then opens the CSV file in write mode, writes the header row using the fieldnames list, and closes the file. This initializes an empty CSV file with the specified fieldnames.

The input text file is then opened in read mode and read using TextBlob to split the file into sentences, which are stored in a list called 'file_sentences'.

The script then loops over each sentence in the list 'file_sentences', calculates its polarity and subjectivity using TextBlob's built-in sentiment analysis function, and determines whether the sentence has a strong opinion based on the polarity and subjectivity scores. If the sentence has a polarity score with an absolute value greater than or equal to 0.7 and a subjectivity score greater than or equal to 0.7, the sentence is considered to have a strong opinion and is given a '1' in the 'STRONG OPINION' column. Otherwise, the sentence is given a '0' in the 'STRONG OPINION' column.

Finally, the script opens the CSV file in append mode and writes a row of data to the file for each sentence, including its sentence ID, polarity, subjectivity, sentence text, and strong opinion flag.

Overall, this script performs sentiment analysis on a given text file and stores the results in a CSV file, including a flag for whether each sentence has a strong opinion or not.
